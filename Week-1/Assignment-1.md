These protocols are organized into layers:

1. **Link Layer**: Provides a way to send or receive data through wired or wireless transmission.
2. **Network Layer**: Responsible for uniquely identifying two different devices over the internet with IP addresses.
3. **Transport Layer**: Transports small chunks of data in a reliable and efficient way. Examples include TCP and UDP.
4. **Application Layer**: The top-level layer where various protocols specific to services and applications on the internet are found, such as HTTP, DNS, and TLS.

## Q2: What are the different types of web servers, and how do they differ in terms of functionality and performance?

Types of web servers include:

6. **Reseller Hosting**: Selling pre-owned server resources in smaller chunks.

## Q4: What is scaling, and why is it important for web applications? How does scaling differ for vertical and horizontal scaling?

**Scaling** is the process of increasing a website's capacity to handle incoming requests, users, and traffic. It ensures accessibility during high traffic.
