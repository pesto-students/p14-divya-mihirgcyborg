    <!-- First stanza of the poem -->
    <p>
      I'm Nobody! Who are you? <br />
      Are you - Nobody - Too? <br />
      Then there's a pair of us! <br />
      Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!
    </p>

    <!-- Second stanza of the poem -->
    <p>
      How dreary - to be - Somebody!<br />
      How public - like a Frog -<br />
      To tell one's name - the livelong June -<br />
      To an admiring Bog!
    </p>
    <p>By <strong>Emily Dickinson</strong> (1891)</p>
